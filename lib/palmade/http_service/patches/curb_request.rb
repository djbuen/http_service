    # This is a patch to OAuth's default Curl::Easy proxy code.
    # As of version, v0.4.1, it's not getting the request method,
    # since Curb::Easy don't set the method until it's time to perform
    # it. So, it's almost impossible to determine the HTTP method just
    # by the Curl::Easy object. I added a specific option (you pass it
    # with the Curl::Client::Helper.new method), :http_method, that
    # will be used as sort of an override, just in case the method
    # can't be retrieved. The mixin CurbRequest below then factors this in.
    #
    # Another fix is the post parameters, if the keys and value are
    # individually escaped, the re-parsing don't unescape
    # them. Unescaping is necessary here to properly produce the
    # correct signature base string.
    class CurbRequest < OAuth::RequestProxy::Curl::Easy
      proxies ::Curl::Easy

            request.headers['Content-Type'].downcase == 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')

          request.post_body.split("&").each do |str|
            param = str.split("=")
            post_body[unescape(param[0])] = unescape(param[1])
